# ClockFS
Is a basic clock, I learn how to use fonts, colours and images in the code. \
This project is built in codepen as it allows to have all three lenguages in the same window and runs them in real time. \
You can execute this at codepen.io or you can watch it work here https://codepen.io/eugeniabm16/full/LYxQKdB
